# CSSZen
"Zen Garden" is a online challenge for programmers where you create a unique disign for a webpage however, you are not able to change any html code. 
This provides a great way to learn the basics of css and graphic design.
Unfortunately, this version of the website does not respond to differing window sizes very well so, stick to 1080p to get the best result.
